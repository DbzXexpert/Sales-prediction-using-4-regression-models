# Sales predicting with 4 regression models 


The daily competition between different shopping malls and large markets is becoming more and more intense, violent simply because of the rapid development of global shopping malls and online shopping. Each market seeks to provide customized and limited time offers to attract many customers according to the period and constraints, so that the sales volume of each item can be estimated for the organization's inventory management, transportation and logistics services. Today's machine learning algorithms are very advanced and provide methods for predicting or forecasting sales for any type of organization, extremely beneficial in overcoming expensive and sometimes non-existent computing resources used for prediction. Better and better forecasts are useful, both for developing and improving marketing strategies for the market, which can make or break the success of a certain company or store.
In this research, we address the topic of predicting Big Mart store item sales based on consumer purchase and demand data at several Big Mart stores at various locations and regarding several items based on data.
For sales volume forecasting, several machine learning methods such as linear regression analysis, random forest, etc. are used.
This is a comprehensive exploratory analysis on Big Mart sales. It is a regression practice problem where we need to predict sales by product and by store.
